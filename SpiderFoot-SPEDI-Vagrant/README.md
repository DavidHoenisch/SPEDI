You can learn more about spiderfoot [here](https://www.spiderfoot.net/documentation/)

### How to deploy

From inside the SpiderFoot-SPEDI-Vagrant directory, run `vagrant up`. The ansible playbook that configures Spiderfoot should automatically run, not  `vagrant provision`.

The above assumes that you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.
